   - API endpoints or components involved
   - Configuration options
   - Example usage
   - Dependencies and requirements
3. Organize features by category (core, scraping, UI, API, etc.)
4. Create or update a FEATURES.md file in the project root
5. Include code references with file paths and line numbers
6. Add troubleshooting tips for common issues

## Output Format

Create a well-structured FEATURES.md file with:
- Table of contents

Focus on practical, actionable documentation that helps developers understand what the system can do and how to use it.
