# Scraping Database Issues - Solution Reference

## Problem: category_id Column Missing Error

**Error Message:** `column "category_id" of relation "scraped_products" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** 
The database migrations were not fully applied. The latest migration (0002_square_white_tiger.sql) contained the necessary schema changes to add the `category_id` column to the `scraped_products` table, but it hadn't been applied to the database.

## Solution Applied

1. **Identified the issue**: The `scraped_products` table was missing several columns that were defined in the schema but not present in the database.

2. **Updated Migration Endpoint**: Enhanced the `/api/migrate` route to include the missing column migrations:
   - Added `category_id` column (uuid, foreign key to categories table)
   - Added `description` column (text)
   - Added `brand` column (varchar)  
   - Added `rating` column (varchar)
   - Added `review_count` column (integer)
   - Created proper foreign key constraint and index for `category_id`

3. **Applied Migration**: Called the migration endpoint with POST request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/migrate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"migrationSecret":"dev-only"}'
   ```

4. **Verified Fix**: Tested scraping functionality and confirmed it works without database errors.

## Files Modified
- `/app/api/migrate/route.ts` - Added category_id column migration logic

## Prevention
- Ensure all database migrations are properly applied when deploying
- The migration endpoint can be used in development to apply schema updates
- Consider using `npm run db:migrate` with proper environment variables in production

## Date Fixed
October 20, 2025

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Scraping functionality restored and working properly
