# Page Loading Loop Fix

## Issue
Pages were not loading and stuck in an infinite redirect/rendering loop.

## Root Causes

### 1. Duplicate HTML/Body Tags in Nested Layout
The `app/landing/layout.tsx` file contained duplicate `<html>` and `<body>` tags, which conflicted with the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`). In Next.js 13+ App Router, only the root layout should render `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

**Problem:**
- Root layout: `app/layout.tsx` → renders `<html>` and `<body>`
- Landing layout: `app/landing/layout.tsx` → ALSO rendered `<html>` and `<body>` (incorrect)

This causes:
- React hydration errors
- Rendering loops
- Page loading issues
- Unpredictable behavior

### 2. Missing Root Path Handling in Middleware
The `middleware.ts` file didn't have explicit handling for the root path `/`. This caused ambiguity about whether the root should be treated as a public or protected route.

**Problem:**
- Root path `/` was not in the `publicPages` array
- No explicit redirect logic for `/` based on authentication status
- Could cause redirect loops or unexpected behavior

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Landing Layout
Removed duplicate `<html>` and `<body>` tags from `app/landing/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
// BEFORE (incorrect)
export default function LandingLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className="antialiased">
        <ThemeProvider>
          <SessionProvider>
            <ToastProvider>
              {children}
            </ToastProvider>
          </SessionProvider>
        </ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

// AFTER (correct)
export default function LandingLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### 2. Added Root Path Redirect in Middleware
Added explicit handling for the root path `/` in `middleware.ts`:

```typescript
// 2. Handle root path - redirect based on auth status
if (pathname === '/') {
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', nextUrl.origin))
  } else {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/landing', nextUrl.origin))
  }
}
```

### 3. Made Header Logo Context-Aware
Updated `components/header.tsx` to make the logo link directly to the appropriate page:

```tsx
const logoHref = session?.user ? "/dashboard" : "/landing";
```

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/user/Downloads/fetchpilot-main/middleware.ts` - Added root path redirect logic
2. `/Users/user/Downloads/fetchpilot-main/app/landing/layout.tsx` - Removed duplicate HTML/body tags
3. `/Users/user/Downloads/fetchpilot-main/components/header.tsx` - Made logo link context-aware
4. `/Users/user/Downloads/fetchpilot-main/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Removed "Back to Home" link that pointed to `/`

## Prevention Guidelines

### Next.js App Router Layouts
- ✅ Only the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) should have `<html>` and `<body>` tags
- ✅ Nested layouts should only wrap children with additional components/providers
- ❌ Never duplicate `<html>` or `<body>` tags in nested layouts

### Middleware Configuration
- ✅ Explicitly handle the root path `/` with clear redirect logic
- ✅ Add all public pages to the `publicPages` array
- ✅ Use consistent redirect patterns based on authentication status
- ❌ Don't leave the root path behavior ambiguous

### Navigation Links
- ✅ Make navigation links context-aware based on authentication status
- ✅ Use direct paths instead of relying on middleware redirects when possible
- ✅ Test navigation from both authenticated and unauthenticated states

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. Visit `/` when not logged in → should redirect to `/landing`
2. Visit `/` when logged in → should redirect to `/dashboard`
3. No infinite redirect loops
4. No React hydration errors
5. Fast page loads with proper SSR
